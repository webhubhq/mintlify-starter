## What is a Dynamic API?

Theres two parts to a Dynamic API. First you have the Core the of API which gives it the ability to make resources for itself and evolve to your growing needs. Second you have the endpoints that are created by the Core to talk to resources and services that are built to meet execute an operation. Two simple example of business operations are saving user data or signing in a user.

## How can I use this API as a non-technical user?

We offer built in UI solutions to execute API commands to build out resources and services for your Dynamic API as well as test out the infrastructure that you have built. 

**Step 1.** Go to our API Reference tab (screenshot below):

**Step 2.** Second, read through the Overview page to get a better understanding of what this Dynamic API has to offer and how to best leverage it for your business use case.

**Step 3.** Lastly, go through our Walkthrough Tutorial page to get a hands on experience with building, testing, and managing your API. 

## I'm a technical user, lets get the ball rolling!

Great! So you know all about APIs. You can use your favorite API platform, in the overview below we will be using Postman to show you an example of endpoints you can create.

**Step 1.** Click on our API Reference tab above then look through the Dynamic API section (screenshot below). Here you will see that we have neatly organized the APIs functionality into easy to use endpoints based off of REST API and OpenAPI standards.

**Step 2.** Once you have built your first AWS resource or service you can look through the rest of the sections (DynamoDB API, S3 API, etc) to see how you can communicate with these resources and services. You'll find that each API exposes extremely useful functionality that AWS and our partnering services provide. We made sure to focus on keeping our APIs succinct and specific while not loosing the customizablity and flexbility that comes with a custom solution. But enought said, go check it out yourself.
