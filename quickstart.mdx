# Getting Started with WebHUB Dynamic API

Welcome to the Mintlify documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to deploy, update and supercharge your documentations with the advanced features Mintlify offers.

## 1. Do you need to handle user data?

With this Dynamic API, you can manage your data with the service that best suits your needs!

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-mixed" title="Manage user data with AWS DynamoDB Tables">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="images" title="Save photos, videos, and files with AWS S3 Bucket">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Do you need a way to make transactions?

We offer built in integrations with Stripe's API to make e-commerce a frictionless experience

No need to worry about configure your own authentication logic, use our seamless integration with Google OAuth.
