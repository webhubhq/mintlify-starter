## My S3 API Functionality

Below is a basic overview of the functionality of your S3 API.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Look for files and folders in your S3 Bucket">
    `GET` /v3/db/s3/\{YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\}/structure
    #
    This end point allows you to see the current file structure of your S3 Bucket. This is useful when you want to look for folders /files in your S3 Bucket or check that edits made to your S3 Bucket have been saved. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create files and folders inside your bucket">
    `POST` /v3/db/s3/\{YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\}/create/\{PATH\}
    #
    This endpoint creates a folder path for your S3 Bucket of value \{PATH\} and if files are uploaded through the body of the POST request, those files will be saved at that directory path. 
  </Accordion>
