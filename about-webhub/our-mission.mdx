In the modern digital era, the real power is in the hands of those who can craft, iterate, and launch applications quickly. Yet, too often, developers find themselves entangled in the intricate web of backend infrastructure - setting up databases, managing servers, ensuring scalability - tasks that are essential but hardly the core of an innovative idea.

Born out of MIT, WebHub is not just a tool but a revolution. We believe in a world where building the backend is as intuitive and enjoyable as crafting the front-end design. With this belief, we have been able to secure funding and support from three major MIT initaitives:
1. **MIT-Pillar AI Collective**
2. **Sandbox Innovation Fund Program**
3. **Momentum Accelerator**

With this support, WebHUB will empower every developer, irrespective of their expertise, to bring any application to life without the intricacies of backend management.
